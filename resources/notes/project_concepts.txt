Efficacy is a noun and is defined as the power or capacity to produce a desired effect. The word efficacy has to do with the ability or capacity to do something, but not about how something is done.

Efficiency is also a noun and is defined as the quality or property of being efficient. Efficient means acting or producing with a minimum or waste, expense, or unnecessary effort.

While efficacy has to do with whether or not something is able to be done at all, efficiency has to do with how something is done and whether or not it is done without much waste, effort, or time.
